Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
-- N/A
2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
-- N/A
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
-- O(n) because it has to visit every node once
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
-- O(n) because the size of `queue` scalec with the size of the tree

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
-- O(n ** 2) due to the nested loops (TWELVE seconds on my computer!)
6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
-- O(n) because the `duplicates` array will increase with the size of the files
7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
-- O(n) Linear because the function is now only looping once (<2 seconds)
8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
-- O(n)
